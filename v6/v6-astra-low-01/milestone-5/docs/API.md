# Partner API

All endpoints are below `/api/v1` and exchange JSON. Authentication is handled upstream and is not
part of this application.

Dates use ISO 8601 calendar dates. Monetary amounts are integer cents. Identifiers are
partner-supplied strings and must be returned unchanged.

## Submit operations

`POST /api/v1/partner-batches`

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "type": "open_group",
      "occurred_on": "2026-10-03",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "guest_id": "guest-22",
      "property_id": "ams-canal",
      "arrival_on": "2026-12-10",
      "departure_on": "2026-12-13",
      "rate_plan": "flexible",
      "rooms": [
        {"room_id": "room-a", "nightly_rate_cents": 15000},
        {"room_id": "room-b", "nightly_rate_cents": 17500}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Operations are processed in array order. An operation can observe changes made by an earlier
operation in the same batch. A rejected operation does not undo earlier successful operations and
does not stop later operations.

A syntactically valid batch returns `200` and one result per operation, in the same order:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "status": "applied",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "deposit_due_cents": 19500
    }
  ]
}
```

Rejected operations have `status: "rejected"` and a stable `code`. A body without an operations
array is an invalid batch and returns `422` as `{"error":{"code":"invalid_batch"}}`.

Every group has a positive integer `revision`. Opening a group creates revision `1`. Each later
applied operation increments the revision of every group whose state it changes, and always the
group it is addressed to, exactly once. This includes operations that derive their group from another identifier.
Rejected operations do not increment it.

An operation addressed to an existing group accepts an optional `expected_revision`. When present,
the operation is applied only if it equals the group's revision immediately before that operation.
Changes made by earlier operations in the same batch are visible. A mismatch is rejected before
other domain validation as:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "op-1002",
  "status": "rejected",
  "code": "stale_revision",
  "group_id": "group-81",
  "expected_revision": 1,
  "actual_revision": 2
}
```

Group existence is resolved first, so an operation naming a missing group still returns
`group_not_found`. Omitting `expected_revision` preserves the existing unconditional behavior.

## Read a group

`GET /api/v1/groups/:group_id`

The response is `{"data": <group>}`. A group contains its partner identifiers, `revision`, booking and stay
dates, rate plan, status, rooms in their original order, and these totals:

- `lodging_total_cents`
- `deposit_due_cents`
- `deposit_paid_cents`
- `outstanding_deposit_cents`

Each room contains `room_id` and `nightly_rate_cents`. A missing group returns
`404` as `{"error":{"code":"group_not_found"}}`.

## Read finance totals

`GET /api/v1/ledger`

The response starts with:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cash_held_cents": 0,
    "cash_refunded_cents": 0,
    "cash_retained_cents": 0
  }
}
```

`cash_held_cents` is cash currently applied to active reservations. Cancellation moves that cash
to either refunded or retained. Unpaid deposit requirements are not cash and never appear in these
totals.

## Transfer a deposit

Submit `transfer_deposit` with `source_group_id`, `destination_group_id`, and positive integer
`amount_cents`. Both groups must be active, distinct, and belong to the same guest. Optional
`expected_revision` guards the source; `destination_expected_revision` guards the destination.
Existence is resolved source first, then destination, followed by revision checks in that order.

Funding moves from the newest source allocations into destination rooms in original room order,
keeping cash payment and credit lot provenance. Transfers do not change ledger totals or credit
expiry. The applied result contains both group identifiers, `amount_cents`,
`source_outstanding_deposit_cents`, `destination_outstanding_deposit_cents`, `source_revision`,
and `destination_revision`. Retries return the stored result under the normal idempotency rules.

Transfer errors are `group_not_found`, `stale_revision`, `invalid_transfer`, `group_not_active`,
`invalid_amount`, `transfer_exceeds_held_funding`, and `transfer_exceeds_outstanding`.
Missing or inactive group errors identify that group with `group_id`.

Payment reductions and chargebacks follow cash across groups. They guard and return the original
payment group's revision, while incrementing every changed group's revision. Transferred funding
settles under the destination's cancellation policy.

After a payment first participates in a transfer, `GET /api/v1/payments/:payment_operation_id`
also returns `held_by_group`: a list of `{group_id, amount_cents}` objects sorted by `group_id`,
omitting zero balances. It becomes an empty list when no cash remains held. Payments that have
never been transferred retain their existing response shape.

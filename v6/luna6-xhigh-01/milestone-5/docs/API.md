# Partner API

All endpoints are below `/api/v1` and exchange JSON. Authentication is handled upstream and is not
part of this application.

Dates use ISO 8601 calendar dates. Monetary amounts are integer cents. Identifiers are
partner-supplied strings and must be returned unchanged.

## Submit operations

`POST /api/v1/partner-batches`

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "type": "open_group",
      "occurred_on": "2026-10-03",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "guest_id": "guest-22",
      "property_id": "ams-canal",
      "arrival_on": "2026-12-10",
      "departure_on": "2026-12-13",
      "rate_plan": "flexible",
      "rooms": [
        {"room_id": "room-a", "nightly_rate_cents": 15000},
        {"room_id": "room-b", "nightly_rate_cents": 17500}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Operations are processed in array order. An operation can observe changes made by an earlier
operation in the same batch. A rejected operation does not undo earlier successful operations and
does not stop later operations.

A syntactically valid batch returns `200` and one result per operation, in the same order:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "status": "applied",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "deposit_due_cents": 19500
    }
  ]
}
```

Rejected operations have `status: "rejected"` and a stable `code`. A body without an operations
array is an invalid batch and returns `422` as `{"error":{"code":"invalid_batch"}}`.

Every group has a positive integer `revision`. Opening a group creates revision `1`. Each later
applied operation increments the revision of every group whose state it changes, and always the
group or groups explicitly addressed by that operation. Rejected operations do not increment a
revision.

An operation addressed to an existing group accepts an optional `expected_revision`. When present,
the operation is applied only if it equals the group's revision immediately before that operation.
Changes made by earlier operations in the same batch are visible. A mismatch is rejected before
other domain validation as:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "op-1002",
  "status": "rejected",
  "code": "stale_revision",
  "group_id": "group-81",
  "expected_revision": 1,
  "actual_revision": 2
}
```

Group existence is resolved first, so an operation naming a missing group still returns
`group_not_found`. Omitting `expected_revision` preserves the existing unconditional behavior.

### Transfer a deposit

Submit a `transfer_deposit` operation with `source_group_id`, `destination_group_id`, and
`amount_cents`. Both groups must exist, be active, be distinct, and belong to the same guest. The
amount moves from the source's held cash and hotel-credit allocations to the destination's
outstanding deposit. Allocation provenance is retained, and the transfer does not change finance
ledger totals.

`expected_revision`, when supplied, guards the source group. `destination_expected_revision`, when
supplied, guards the destination. The source is resolved first, then the destination; after both
exist, the source revision is checked before the destination revision. An applied transfer increments
both groups once and returns both resulting revisions:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "op-1003",
  "status": "applied",
  "source_group_id": "group-81",
  "destination_group_id": "group-92",
  "amount_cents": 1000,
  "source_outstanding_deposit_cents": 500,
  "destination_outstanding_deposit_cents": 2500,
  "source_revision": 4,
  "destination_revision": 2
}
```

## Read a group

`GET /api/v1/groups/:group_id`

The response is `{"data": <group>}`. A group contains its partner identifiers, `revision`, booking and stay
dates, rate plan, status, rooms in their original order, and these totals:

- `lodging_total_cents`
- `deposit_due_cents`
- `deposit_paid_cents`
- `outstanding_deposit_cents`

Each room contains `room_id` and `nightly_rate_cents`. A missing group returns
`404` as `{"error":{"code":"group_not_found"}}`.

## Reconcile a payment

`GET /api/v1/payments/:payment_operation_id` returns the current cash disposition for an applied
cash payment. After any portion of that payment has participated in a deposit transfer, the response
also includes `held_by_group`, ordered by `group_id`. It lists only groups currently holding cash;
once no cash remains held, the list is empty. Payments that have never participated in a transfer
keep the earlier statement shape without this field.

## Read finance totals

`GET /api/v1/ledger`

The response starts with:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cash_held_cents": 0,
    "cash_refunded_cents": 0,
    "cash_retained_cents": 0
  }
}
```

`cash_held_cents` is cash currently applied to active reservations. Cancellation moves that cash
to either refunded or retained. Unpaid deposit requirements are not cash and never appear in these
totals.

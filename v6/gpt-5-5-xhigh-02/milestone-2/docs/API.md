# Partner API

All endpoints are below `/api/v1` and exchange JSON. Authentication is handled upstream and is not
part of this application.

Dates use ISO 8601 calendar dates. Monetary amounts are integer cents. Identifiers are
partner-supplied strings and must be returned unchanged.

## Submit operations

`POST /api/v1/partner-batches`

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "type": "open_group",
      "occurred_on": "2026-10-03",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "guest_id": "guest-22",
      "property_id": "ams-canal",
      "arrival_on": "2026-12-10",
      "departure_on": "2026-12-13",
      "rate_plan": "flexible",
      "rooms": [
        {"room_id": "room-a", "nightly_rate_cents": 15000},
        {"room_id": "room-b", "nightly_rate_cents": 17500}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Operations are processed in array order. An operation can observe changes made by an earlier
operation in the same batch. A rejected operation does not undo earlier successful operations and
does not stop later operations.

A syntactically valid batch returns `200` and one result per operation, in the same order:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "status": "applied",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "deposit_due_cents": 19500,
      "revision": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Rejected operations have `status: "rejected"` and a stable `code`. A body without an operations
array is an invalid batch and returns `422` as `{"error":{"code":"invalid_batch"}}`.

Every group has a positive integer `revision`. Opening a group creates revision `1`. Each later
applied operation addressed to that group increments its revision exactly once and returns the
resulting revision. This includes operations that derive their group from another identifier.
Rejected operations do not increment it.

An operation addressed to an existing group accepts an optional `expected_revision`. When present,
the operation is applied only if it equals the group's revision immediately before that operation.
Changes made by earlier operations in the same batch are visible. A mismatch is rejected before
other domain validation as:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "op-1002",
  "status": "rejected",
  "code": "stale_revision",
  "group_id": "group-81",
  "expected_revision": 1,
  "actual_revision": 2
}
```

Group existence is resolved first, so an operation naming a missing group still returns
`group_not_found`. Omitting `expected_revision` preserves the existing unconditional behavior.

`cancel_group` accepts optional `refund_method`, either `cash` or `hotel_credit`. Omitting it means
`cash`. A refundable cancellation with `hotel_credit` converts the cash-funded deposit to hotel
credit and returns `credit_issued_cents`; a non-refundable cancellation with `hotel_credit` is
rejected with `refund_method_not_available`.

`apply_hotel_credit` contains `group_id` and `amount_cents`. It follows the same revision and
payment validation rules as cash payments, and rejects unavailable guest credit with
`insufficient_credit`. The applied result contains `group_id`, `amount_cents`,
`outstanding_deposit_cents`, and `revision`.

## Read a group

`GET /api/v1/groups/:group_id`

The response is `{"data": <group>}`. A group contains its partner identifiers, `revision`, booking and stay
dates, rate plan, status, `policy_version`, `refundable_until`, rooms in their original order, and
these totals:

- `lodging_total_cents`
- `deposit_due_cents`
- `deposit_paid_cents`
- `cash_paid_cents`
- `credit_paid_cents`
- `outstanding_deposit_cents`

Each room contains `room_id` and `nightly_rate_cents`. A missing group returns
`404` as `{"error":{"code":"group_not_found"}}`.

`policy_version` is `flex-14`, `flex-30`, or `advance-nonrefundable`. `refundable_until` is the
last refundable cancellation date for flexible groups and `null` for advance-purchase groups.

## Read finance totals

`GET /api/v1/ledger`

Accepts optional `on=YYYY-MM-DD` and otherwise reports credit expiry as of the current UTC date.

The response starts with:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cash_held_cents": 0,
    "cash_refunded_cents": 0,
    "cash_retained_cents": 0,
    "cash_converted_to_credit_cents": 0,
    "credit_liability_cents": 0
  }
}
```

`cash_held_cents` is cash currently applied to active reservations. Cancellation moves that cash
to refunded, retained, or converted-to-credit totals. `credit_liability_cents` includes available
unexpired hotel credit plus hotel credit currently applied to active groups. Unpaid deposit
requirements are not cash and never appear in these totals.

## Read guest credit

`GET /api/v1/guests/:guest_id/credit`

Accepts optional `on=YYYY-MM-DD` and otherwise reports credit expiry as of the current UTC date.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "guest_id": "guest-22",
    "available_cents": 5500,
    "lots": [
      {
        "source_operation_id": "cancel-17",
        "remaining_cents": 5500,
        "expires_on": "2028-05-02"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Lots not yet issued as of the report date, expired lots, and exhausted lots are omitted. Lots are
ordered by `expires_on`, then by `source_operation_id`.

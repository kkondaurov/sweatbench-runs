# Partner API

All endpoints are below `/api/v1` and exchange JSON. Authentication is handled upstream and is not
part of this application.

Dates use ISO 8601 calendar dates. Monetary amounts are integer cents. Identifiers are
partner-supplied strings and must be returned unchanged.

## Submit operations

`POST /api/v1/partner-batches`

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "type": "open_group",
      "occurred_on": "2026-10-03",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "guest_id": "guest-22",
      "property_id": "ams-canal",
      "arrival_on": "2026-12-10",
      "departure_on": "2026-12-13",
      "rate_plan": "flexible",
      "rooms": [
        {"room_id": "room-a", "nightly_rate_cents": 15000},
        {"room_id": "room-b", "nightly_rate_cents": 17500}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Operations are processed in array order. An operation can observe changes made by an earlier
operation in the same batch. A rejected operation does not undo earlier successful operations and
does not stop later operations.

A syntactically valid batch returns `200` and one result per operation, in the same order:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "status": "applied",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "deposit_due_cents": 19500
    }
  ]
}
```

Rejected operations have `status: "rejected"` and a stable `code`. A body without an operations
array is an invalid batch and returns `422` as `{"error":{"code":"invalid_batch"}}`.

Every group has a positive integer `revision`. Opening a group creates revision `1`. Each later
applied operation addressed to that group increments its revision exactly once and returns the
resulting revision. This includes operations that derive their group from another identifier.
Rejected operations do not increment it.

An operation addressed to an existing group accepts an optional `expected_revision`. When present,
the operation is applied only if it equals the group's revision immediately before that operation.
Changes made by earlier operations in the same batch are visible. A mismatch is rejected before
other domain validation as:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "op-1002",
  "status": "rejected",
  "code": "stale_revision",
  "group_id": "group-81",
  "expected_revision": 1,
  "actual_revision": 2
}
```

Group existence is resolved first, so an operation naming a missing group still returns
`group_not_found`. Omitting `expected_revision` preserves the existing unconditional behavior.

## Read a group

`GET /api/v1/groups/:group_id`

The response is `{"data": <group>}`. A group contains its partner identifiers, `revision`, booking and stay
dates, rate plan, status, rooms in their original order, and these totals:

- `lodging_total_cents`
- `deposit_due_cents`
- `deposit_paid_cents`
- `outstanding_deposit_cents`

Each room contains `room_id`, `nightly_rate_cents`, `status`, `lodging_total_cents`,
`deposit_due_cents`, `cash_paid_cents`, and `credit_paid_cents`. Room status is `active` or
`cancelled`; group totals include active rooms only. A missing group returns `404` as
`{"error":{"code":"group_not_found"}}`.

## Read finance totals

`GET /api/v1/ledger`

The response starts with:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cash_held_cents": 0,
    "cash_refunded_cents": 0,
    "cash_retained_cents": 0,
    "cash_converted_to_credit_cents": 0,
    "cash_reduced_cents": 0,
    "cash_charged_back_cents": 0,
    "credit_liability_cents": 0,
    "credit_shortfall_cents": 0
  }
}
```

`cash_held_cents` is cash currently applied to active reservations. Cancellation moves that cash
to either refunded or retained. Unpaid deposit requirements are not cash and never appear in these
totals.

## Room cancellations and payment corrections

`cancel_rooms` accepts `group_id`, `room_ids`, `occurred_on`, and the optional `refund_method`
accepted by `cancel_group`. Every supplied room must be distinct and active. It settles only those
rooms, returns their identifiers in original room order, and returns the same refund, retention,
credit-issued, and revision fields as a full cancellation.

`reduce_cash_payment` accepts `payment_operation_id`, positive `amount_cents`, and optional
`expected_revision`. It reverses only cash from that payment that remains held on active rooms.
`charge_back_payment` accepts `payment_operation_id` and optional `expected_revision`; it
reclassifies all of the payment's remaining cash, including already refunded, retained, or converted
cash. Both operations return the original payment's group and resulting revision, and both follow
the same durable idempotency contract as every other partner operation.

## Reconcile a payment

`GET /api/v1/payments/:payment_operation_id` returns the current disposition of a durably applied
cash payment. Its `data` includes `payment_operation_id`, `original_group_id`, `recorded_cents`,
`held_cents`, `refunded_cents`, `retained_cents`, `converted_to_credit_cents`, `reduced_cents`,
and `charged_back_cents`. The disposition amounts sum to `recorded_cents`.

An unknown operation returns `404` with `operation_not_found`; an operation that is not an applied
cash payment returns `422` with `payment_not_reconcilable`.

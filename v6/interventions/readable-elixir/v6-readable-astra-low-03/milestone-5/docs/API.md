# Partner API

All endpoints are below `/api/v1` and exchange JSON. Authentication is handled upstream and is not
part of this application.

Dates use ISO 8601 calendar dates. Monetary amounts are integer cents. Identifiers are
partner-supplied strings and must be returned unchanged.

## Submit operations

`POST /api/v1/partner-batches`

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "type": "open_group",
      "occurred_on": "2026-10-03",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "guest_id": "guest-22",
      "property_id": "ams-canal",
      "arrival_on": "2026-12-10",
      "departure_on": "2026-12-13",
      "rate_plan": "flexible",
      "rooms": [
        {"room_id": "room-a", "nightly_rate_cents": 15000},
        {"room_id": "room-b", "nightly_rate_cents": 17500}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Operations are processed in array order. An operation can observe changes made by an earlier
operation in the same batch. A rejected operation does not undo earlier successful operations and
does not stop later operations.

A syntactically valid batch returns `200` and one result per operation, in the same order:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "status": "applied",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "deposit_due_cents": 19500
    }
  ]
}
```

Rejected operations have `status: "rejected"` and a stable `code`. A body without an operations
array is an invalid batch and returns `422` as `{"error":{"code":"invalid_batch"}}`.

Every group has a positive integer `revision`. Opening a group creates revision `1`. Each later
applied operation increments its addressed group and every other group whose state it changes,
exactly once each. This includes operations that derive their group from another identifier.
Payment corrections return the original payment group’s revision; transfers return both revisions.
Rejected operations do not increment it.

An operation addressed to an existing group accepts an optional `expected_revision`. When present,
the operation is applied only if it equals the group's revision immediately before that operation.
Changes made by earlier operations in the same batch are visible. A mismatch is rejected before
other domain validation as:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "op-1002",
  "status": "rejected",
  "code": "stale_revision",
  "group_id": "group-81",
  "expected_revision": 1,
  "actual_revision": 2
}
```

Group existence is resolved first, so an operation naming a missing group still returns
`group_not_found`. Omitting `expected_revision` preserves the existing unconditional behavior.

## Read a group

`GET /api/v1/groups/:group_id`

The response is `{"data": <group>}`. A group contains its partner identifiers, `revision`, booking and stay
dates, rate plan, status, rooms in their original order, and these totals:

- `lodging_total_cents`
- `deposit_due_cents`
- `deposit_paid_cents`
- `outstanding_deposit_cents`

Each room contains `room_id` and `nightly_rate_cents`. A missing group returns
`404` as `{"error":{"code":"group_not_found"}}`.

## Read finance totals

`GET /api/v1/ledger`

The response starts with:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cash_held_cents": 0,
    "cash_refunded_cents": 0,
    "cash_retained_cents": 0
  }
}
```

`cash_held_cents` is cash currently applied to active reservations. Cancellation moves that cash
to either refunded or retained. Unpaid deposit requirements are not cash and never appear in these
totals.

## Transfer an applied deposit

Submit `transfer_deposit` with `source_group_id`, `destination_group_id`, and a positive
`amount_cents`. Both groups must be distinct, active, and belong to the same guest. Optional
`expected_revision` guards the source; `destination_expected_revision` guards the destination.
Existence is checked source first, then destination, followed by those two revision guards.

Funding moves in reverse allocation creation order, mixing cash and credit. Destination rooms
fill in original room order. Payment and credit-lot provenance, paused credit expiry, and all ledger
totals are preserved. The applied result includes both group identifiers, `amount_cents`,
`source_outstanding_deposit_cents`, `destination_outstanding_deposit_cents`, `source_revision`, and
`destination_revision`. Transfers have the same durable retry guarantees as other operations.

Later payment reductions and chargebacks follow cash across groups. They guard the original payment
group and increment every affected group once. A payment statement adds `held_by_group` after cash
from that payment first participates in a transfer. Entries contain `group_id` and `amount_cents`,
ordered by group identifier, omitting zero balances. The field remains present as an empty array
when no held cash remains; payments never transferred retain their existing statement shape.

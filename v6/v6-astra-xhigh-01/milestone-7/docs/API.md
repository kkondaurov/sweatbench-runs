# Partner API

All endpoints are below `/api/v1` and exchange JSON. Authentication is handled upstream and is not
part of this application.

Dates use ISO 8601 calendar dates. Monetary amounts are integer cents. Identifiers are
partner-supplied strings and must be returned unchanged.

## Submit operations

`POST /api/v1/partner-batches`

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "type": "open_group",
      "occurred_on": "2026-10-03",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "guest_id": "guest-22",
      "property_id": "ams-canal",
      "arrival_on": "2026-12-10",
      "departure_on": "2026-12-13",
      "rate_plan": "flexible",
      "rooms": [
        {"room_id": "room-a", "nightly_rate_cents": 15000},
        {"room_id": "room-b", "nightly_rate_cents": 17500}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Operations are processed in array order. An operation can observe changes made by an earlier
operation in the same batch. A rejected operation does not undo earlier successful operations and
does not stop later operations.

A syntactically valid batch returns `200` and one result per operation, in the same order:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "operation_id": "op-1001",
      "status": "applied",
      "group_id": "group-81",
      "deposit_due_cents": 19500
    }
  ]
}
```

Rejected operations have `status: "rejected"` and a stable `code`. A body without an operations
array is an invalid batch and returns `422` as `{"error":{"code":"invalid_batch"}}`.

Every group has a positive integer `revision`. Opening a group creates revision `1`. Each later
applied operation addressed to that group increments its revision exactly once and returns the
resulting revision. This includes operations that derive their group from another identifier.
Rejected operations do not increment it.

An operation addressed to an existing group accepts an optional `expected_revision`. When present,
the operation is applied only if it equals the group's revision immediately before that operation.
Changes made by earlier operations in the same batch are visible. A mismatch is rejected before
other domain validation as:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "op-1002",
  "status": "rejected",
  "code": "stale_revision",
  "group_id": "group-81",
  "expected_revision": 1,
  "actual_revision": 2
}
```

Group existence is resolved first, so an operation naming a missing group still returns
`group_not_found`. Omitting `expected_revision` preserves the existing unconditional behavior.

## Read a group

`GET /api/v1/groups/:group_id`

The response is `{"data": <group>}`. A group contains its partner identifiers, `revision`, booking and stay
dates, rate plan, status, rooms in their original order, and these totals:

- `lodging_total_cents`
- `deposit_due_cents`
- `deposit_paid_cents`
- `outstanding_deposit_cents`

Each room contains `room_id` and `nightly_rate_cents`. A missing group returns
`404` as `{"error":{"code":"group_not_found"}}`.

## Read finance totals

`GET /api/v1/ledger`

The response starts with:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cash_held_cents": 0,
    "cash_refunded_cents": 0,
    "cash_retained_cents": 0
  }
}
```

`cash_held_cents` is cash currently applied to active reservations. Cancellation moves that cash
to either refunded or retained. Unpaid deposit requirements are not cash and never appear in these
totals.

## Close a finance period

Submit `close_finance_period` through the partner batch endpoint with `operation_id` and
`period_end_on` (an ISO 8601 date). It does not address a group or check revisions. Reporting must
already have started, and the cutoff must be on or after `starts_on` and strictly after any prior
successful cutoff. Invalid periods return `invalid_period`.

An applied close returns exactly `operation_id`, `status: "applied"`, and `period_end_on`. Durable
retries and identifier conflicts follow the same rules as other operations.

`GET /api/v1/finance/daily-report?date=YYYY-MM-DD` returns `status: "closed"` through the cutoff.
Once closed, a report's `data` stays unchanged. Later operations post on the latest of their
`occurred_on`, reporting inception, and the day after the cutoff in force when they commit.

Every report includes `late_adjustments: {"cash": [], "credit": {...}}`. Its cash rows contain
`property_id` and the usual cash `movements` fields; its credit object contains the usual credit
movement fields directly. These signed movements were moved forward by a close and are separate
from ordinary `movements`. Add both classifications when reconciling opening and closing balances.
Late cash rows are sorted by property and omit all-zero movements; the credit object is always
present with every field. Natural credit expiry whose date remains in the open period remains an
ordinary movement. Closing affects finance reports only; current group, ledger, and payment views
continue to reflect all applied operations.
